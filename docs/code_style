#BayOS Coding-Style#
####################

We consider an uniform coding- and naming-style as necessary, so we'll write it
down!

0. Preamble and general conventions
        - line-length shall be a maximum of 80 characters

1. Naming convention

2. Indentation
        - one indentation MUST be 8 spaces
        - DO NOT use the GNU double-indentation! It's just useless!

3. Comments
        - we wanna achieve a uniform comment style. you shall use 
          /**/-comments. //-comments are just ugly and not multi-line capable so
          you must use /**/ for a uniform style.
